This project aims to develop a machine learning model in Python to predict the presence or absence
of heart disease in individuals. Different machine learning algorithms which are random forest, logistic
regression, bagging, gradient boosting, decision trees, adaboost, and stacking are employed to train and
evaluate the predictive model. Feature engineering techniques, data pre-processing, and model optimiza-
tion are applied to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the predictive model. The project outcome
includes a comparative analysis of different algorithms, performance metrics such as accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1 score, and insights into the most influential factors contributing to heart disease prediction.
This project contributes to the advancement of medical diagnostics using machine learning techniques
and provides a valuable tool for early detection and prevention of heart-related.
